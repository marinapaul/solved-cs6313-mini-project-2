 <li>Consider the dataset csv posted on eLearning. It contains observations on 5875 runners who finished the 2010 Beach to Beacon 10K Road Race in Cape Elizabeth, Maine. You can read the dataset in R using read.csv function.

  <ul>

   <li>Create a bar graph of the variable Maine, which identifies whether a runner is from Maine or from somewhere else (stated using Maine and Away). You can use barplot function for this. What can we conclude from the plot? Back up your conclusions with relevant summary statistics.</li>

  </ul></li>

 <li>Create two histograms the runners’ times (given in minutes) — one for theMaine group and the second for the Away Make sure that the histograms on the same scale. What can we conclude about the two distributions? Back up your conclusions with relevant summary statistics, including mean, standard deviation, range, median, and interquartile range.</li>

 <li>Repeat (b) but with side-by-side boxplots.</li>

 <li>Create side-by-side boxplots for the runners’ ages (given in years) for male andfemale runners. What can we conclude about the two distributions? Back up your conclusions with relevant summary statistics, including mean, standard deviation, range, median, and interquartile range.</li>

 <li> Consider the dataset csv posted on eLearning. It contains the number of fatal motorcycle accidents that occurred in each county of South Carolina during 2009. Create a boxplot of data and provide relevant summary statistics. Discuss the features of the data distribution. Identify which counties may be considered outliers. Why might these counties have the highest numbers of motorcycle fatalities in South Carolina?</li>
